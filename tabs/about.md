Hi, I am a MS student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst. I am looking for full time opportunities as a Software Developer Engineer. 

I have experience working in C++ and Python. Some of my favorite projects I have worked on are
1. SnakeProf - It is a Profiler for Python. It takes a Python program and its arguments as input and ouputs detailed profiling information.
2. Smash - Smash is a compressing memory allocator written in C++. It creates a wrapper over `malloc` and `free`. Smash compresses idle application memory pages and stores it in the disk. When an application requests pages which are compressed, it uncompresses them. Thus, the application program is not aware of the compression system and runs smoothly.
