The last few days have been quite stressful due to moving out of our previous apartment and moving in to the new apartment. My roommates and I were drained out of energy carying all furniture and equipment down two flights of stairs from our previous building. Also, many thanks to a friend who helped us during this move out and move in.

However, moving in to the new building was comparatively easier than expected. It involved picking stuff only one flight of stairs. And we had a much needed rest for a couple of days after that. We used a U-Haul truck. It was a smooth experience altogether.

Finally, I hope to continue this blog regularly from now on.
