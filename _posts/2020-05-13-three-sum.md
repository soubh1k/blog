**Problem Statement**

> Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers, are there elements _a_, _b_, _c_ in nums such that _a + b + c = 0_? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

NOTE:
1. The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Solution Approach**

* This problem is similar to that of 2 sum problem with 2 pointers in such a way that here, we fix a value and use two pointers approach to find 3 numbers that sum up to 0.
* We do this for all values in the array.
* Since, there may be a possibility of duplicate triplets, we sort the array at the beginning and skip elements when we find them the same as before.

**Complexity**

Let _n_ be the size of the input array.
* Time complexity - _O(n^2))_, as we traverse the array for _n_ times in the 1st iteration, _n-1_ times in the 2nd and so on. This sums up to _O(n^2)_
* Space complexity - _O(1)_, as we are not using any extra space.

public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if(nums.size()<3)
            return result;
        
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) {
            int low=i+1;
            int high=nums.size()-1;
            while(low<high) {
                int val = nums[i]+nums[low]+nums[high];
                if(val==0) {
                    vector<int> temp = {nums[i], nums[low], nums[high]};
                    result.push_back(temp);
                    while(low<high && nums[low]==temp[1])
                        low++;
                    while(low<high && nums[high]==temp[2])
                        high--;
                }
                else if(val<0)
                    low++;
                else
                    high--;
