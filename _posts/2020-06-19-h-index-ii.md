[**LeetCode Question Link**](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/){:target="_blank"}

**Problem Statement**

> Given an array of citations **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

> According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index `h` if `h` of his/her `N` papers have **at least** `h` citations each, and the other `N âˆ’ h` papers have **no more than** `h` citations each."

**Solution Approach**

* We use binary search to find the maximum possible h index of a researcher.
* If we find that the number of citations in the middle element is less than the number of papers having more citations, we discard the left side and perform binary search on the right side of the array.

**Complexity**

Let n be the size of the array.
* Time complexity - _O(log n)_ to perform binary search.
* Space complexity - _O(1)_ since we don't use any extra space.

**Code**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int low = 1, high = citations.size();
        int mid;
        int h = 0;
        while(low<=high) {
            mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            h = max(h, min((int)citations.size() - (mid-1), citations[mid-1]));
            if(citations.size() - (mid) < citations[mid-1])
                high = mid - 1;
            else
                low = mid + 1;
        }
        return h;
    }
};
```
